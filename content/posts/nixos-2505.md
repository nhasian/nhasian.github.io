NixOS 25.05 was just released [a few days ago](https://nixos.org/blog/announcements/2025/nixos-2505/). I did a fresh install in a VM to test it out. 

According to the release notes:

> The nixos-generate-config command now supports a optional --flake option, which will generate a flake.nix file alongside the configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix, providing an easy introduction into flake-based system configurations.

Thus far, I haven't needed to use flakes in my system, but I am curious to check it out!
